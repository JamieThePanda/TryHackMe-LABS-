🧠 What I Learned in This Module (LAN Topologies + Devices)
I found this room genuinely fun and engaging!

I learned about different LAN topologies, which helped me better understand why certain network designs are used in real environments. I studied their advantages and disadvantages, which gave me a clearer picture of their strengths and limitations.

⭐ Star Topology
The most common LAN layout — all devices connect to a central networking device (like a switch or hub). It’s known for being reliable and scalable, though it comes with higher installation and maintenance costs.

Advantages:

Easy to add more devices (scalable)

Reliable central communication

Disadvantages:

More expensive to implement

If the central device fails, the network goes down

🚌 Bus Topology
A single cable (the “bus”) runs through the network, and all devices tap into it — like leaves on a branch.

Advantages:

Simple to set up

Cost-effective

Disadvantages:

Prone to bottlenecks as more devices join

Troubleshooting can be tricky

No redundancy

🔁 Ring Topology
Devices are connected in a loop, and data travels in one direction around the ring. This reduces cabling but introduces a single point of failure.

Advantages:

Less chance of collisions (due to one-way traffic)

Easier to identify failure points

Disadvantages:

If one segment fails, the whole network can go down

Not very redundant

Slower data transfer compared to more modern designs

🖧 Switches
Thanks to my Cisco Networking course, I had some background on switches — they play a key role in LAN networks, acting as the central communication point for Ethernet-connected devices.

Switches are smarter than hubs. They store MAC addresses in a table (MAC address table) so they know which port to send traffic out of, reducing unnecessary data flooding and increasing efficiency.

🌍 Routers
Routers enable communication beyond the local network (LAN to WAN/Internet). They route data between networks using default gateways, which is like the "exit door" from your local network.

My prior networking experience helped reinforce my understanding of how routers direct traffic, especially across subnets or to the internet.

💭 Final Thoughts
This room helped reinforce practical knowledge I had from the Cisco Networking course, while also giving me new perspective on the reasons behind LAN 


🌍 Subnetting 

Today’s task focused on understanding subnetting—the process of dividing a network into smaller, manageable sub-networks. This is especially useful in larger environments like businesses where departments such as Accounting, HR, and Finance each require their own segment of the network.

Key Concepts Covered:
Subnetting is like slicing a cake—you divide a finite resource (IP addresses) and assign pieces (subnets) to different groups or functions.

Subnet Masks help define the size and range of a subnet, working alongside IP addresses.

IP Address Breakdown:
Type	Purpose	Example
Network Address	Identifies the start of the network.	192.168.1.0
Host Address	Identifies a specific device on the network.	192.168.1.100
Default Gateway	Sends traffic to other networks, often .1 or .254 in the subnet range.	192.168.1.254

Why Subnet?
Efficiency – Organizes IPs and prevents waste.

Security – Keeps sensitive systems (e.g. employee networks) separated from public access points like guest Wi-Fi.

Control – Enables precise network management and segmentation.

Real-World Example:
A café might use subnetting to keep public Wi-Fi separate from their internal systems like registers and staff devices, maintaining security while still providing Internet access.

📘 OSI Model Overview – The 7 Layers

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model breaks down network communication into 7 layers, each responsible for a specific function in transmitting data from one device to another.

🌐 Layer 7 – Application
This is where the user interacts with the network (e.g., web browsers, email clients). It provides network services to applications.

🎭 Layer 6 – Presentation
Responsible for translating data formats (like encryption, compression, encoding). Makes sure data is readable by the destination.

🧠 Layer 5 – Session
Manages sessions between two devices. Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.

📦 Layer 4 – Transport
Controls reliable data transfer with protocols like TCP and UDP. Handles segmentation, error detection, and flow control.

📫 Layer 3 – Network
Handles routing and logical addressing (IP addresses). Determines the best path for data to travel across networks.

🔗 Layer 2 – Data Link
Deals with physical addressing (MAC addresses), error detection, and frame delivery over the physical network.

⚙️ Layer 1 – Physical
Covers the actual hardware transmission — cables, switches, electrical signals, and bits on the wire.

✅ Summary:
Understanding the OSI model helps troubleshoot where problems occur and better understand how data moves through a network from application to hardware.
